## What you'll find here

To learn Electron, I'm breaking down the [electron-api-demos](https://github.com/electron/electron-api-demos) app into bite-sized indiviudal apps

## Why create individual apps

This is a personal call to action pet project. As an industry, we need to standardize on an "After Hello World" format. We're great at Hello World getting started apps, but then leave the developer hanging afterwards. 

I call it the "get into Art School for free" challenge from those [old TV commercial ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz2nu4a1LyI). You draw two circles then you're expected to draw the rest of the turtle pirate. As an industry, we can do better.
