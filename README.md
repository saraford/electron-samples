### What you'll find here

To learn Electron, I'm breaking down the [electron-api-demos](https://github.com/electron/electron-api-demos) app into bite-sized indiviudal apps

### Why create individual apps

**This is a personal call to action pet project.** As an industry, we need to standardize on an "After Hello World" format. We're great at Hello World getting started apps, but then leave the developer hanging afterwards. 

I call it the "get into Art School for free" challenge from those old TV commercial ads. You draw two circles then you're expected to draw the rest of the turtle pirate. As an industry, we can do better. 

Potential developers should read the **After Hello World** template and when they reach part 11, they should say to themselves, "Whoa… if I follow these steps, I can produce an app very similar to these popular ones?! That means I will have learned everything I need to create my app idea!" 

Every dev has an idea they want to express. Otherwise, they wouldn't be here :)
