We're great at Hello World getting started apps, but then leave the developer hanging afterwards. \r\n\r\nI call it the \"get into Art School for free\" challenge from those old TV commercial ads. You draw two circles then you're expected to draw the rest of the turtle pirate. As an industry, we can do better. \r\n\r\nPotential developers should read the **After Hello World** template and when they reach part 11, they should say to themselves, \"Whoa… if I follow these steps, I can produce an app very similar to these popular ones?! That means I will have learned everything I need to create my app idea!\" \r\n\r\nEvery dev has an idea they want to express. Otherwise, they wouldn't be here :)\r\n\r\n### After Hello World\r\n\r\n**Part 1 - Installing your developer environment + Hello World**\r\n\r\n- Install / FAQ\r\n- Hello World\r\n- Hello World as console.log output\r\n- Hello World as a separate Window\r\n- Hello World as a system dialog\r\n\r\n**Part 2 - Input and output**\r\n- TODO - figure something out here\r\n\r\n- Adding a button and listening for the click event.\r\n- Adding a label and having it respond to the click event.\r\n- Adding a textbox and doing something with user input\r\n  - <rinse and repeat for all controls>\r\n  - Example apps:\r\n    - Stopwatch\r\n\r\n**Part 3 - Debugging (because at this point you'll need it)**\r\n\r\n- Crashes and hangs\r\n- Tips and tricks for debugging (and avoiding bugs :)\r\n- Other things to know re debugging x-platform?\r\n\r\n**Part 4 - UI Frameworks**\r\n\r\n- Keyboard shortcuts\r\n- Using the native UI?? E.g. Put your app in the tray\r\n- Which UI framework to use?? - I'm still trying to figure out how which UI framework to invest in learning for electron…\r\n\r\n**Part 5 -System info, clipboard, protocol handler**\r\n\r\n- TODO - figure something out here\r\n\r\n**Part 6 - working with external content**\r\n\r\n- Open external links\r\n- Pulling in RSS feed\r\n- Calling various APIs to make app\r\n- Example apps:\r\n  - GitHub Zen app\r\n\r\n**Part 7 - Talk between two processes**\r\n\r\n**Part 8 - Navigation**\r\n\r\n- Opening different windows\r\n- Adding a navigation bar\r\n- Example apps\r\n  - Weather app (similar to iOS weather app)\r\n\r\nPart 9 - Storage\r\n\r\n- How to save content\r\n- How to save user settings\r\n- Example app\r\n  - Todo list\r\n\r\nPart 10 - Media\r\n\r\n- How to handle media (audio, video, etc)\r\n-  e.g. Pinterest app\r\n\r\nPart 11 - Popular App Clones - How to\r\n\r\n- Create an instagram clone, snapchat clone.\r\n\r\nPart 12 - Misc\r\n\r\n- Packaging and deploying\r\n- How to test across different platforms\r\n- Choosing a license / open sourcing on GitHub / aka ChooseALicense.com\r\n- Choose your own software adventure",
